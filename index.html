                My name is Liezl.
                <br><br>
                I am an engineer lead here through my love of math.
                <lowlight>
                    Growing up, I had a thing for math. While my favorite activity was
                    playing sports, of all academic assignments, I always finished my
                    math homework first and exhausted all courses available to me in
                    secondary school. When it came time to choose a major in college, I
                    ended up choosing engineering because it appeared more readily
                    applicable than a pure math degree. My choice of electrical
                    engineering was more of a random selection process. However, being
                    such a broad field, I was introduced to a variety of topics to pique
                    my curiosity, ranging from circuits to signals and systems to
                    control theory and eventually robotics.
                </lowlight>
                <br><br>
                For the past three years, I have been working in a research lab that
                uses deep learning for pose estimation.
                <lowlight>
                    During my time in the lab, I was able to gain experience using best
                    practices as a Python software engineer, all while working to
                    maintain and develop upon an entire computer vision ecosystem.
                </lowlight>
                <br><br>
                I am currently focused on sharpening my skillset in computer vision and
                reinforcement learning.
                <lowlight>
                    I strive to build upon an understanding of the fundamental
                    principles that underpin these fields and not only apply them to
                    real-world problems, but also to contribute to the advancement of
                    these fields. I believe that by sharing my knowledge and
                    collaborating with others, we can drive innovation and create
                    meaningful change in the world.
                </lowlight>
                <br><br>
                Let's do great things together.
