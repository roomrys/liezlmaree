# liezlmaree

My own under-maintained [personal page](https://roomrys.github.io/liezlmaree/) where I
aim to create a portfolio for myself that is a bit more comprehensive than [my github](https://github.com/roomrys).

### To future me

Our implementation of the top bar requires us to serve the site while developing. Hence, we cannot simply open index.html in the browser, but need to locally host the website. Past you has used:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

.
